    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1KG bone-in lamb shoulder</li>
        <li>8 carrots</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Method</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the lamb out of the fridge half an hour before cooking. Cut the garlic head in half and rub over the meat. Cover the shoudler in salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200c. Roughly chop the carrots and onions, peel the garlic, and place them all at the bottom of a roasting tin.</li>
        <li>Place the lamb on top of the veg ans fill the tin with 2 pints of water. You are aiming to cover most of the lamb with this.</li>
        <li>Tent the tin with foil and put it in the oven for half an hour. When this half hour is up, turn the heat to 150c and cook for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>For the final half an hour, remove the foil to brown and crisp the lamb.</li>
        <li>When cooking is complete, take the lamb from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes. No need to carve this meat, it should just fall off the bone.</li>
        <li>Serve with potatoes of your choice, the roasted veg, and a good serving of that stock.</li>
    </ol>
